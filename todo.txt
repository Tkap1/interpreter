factorial
fibbonacci
primes


problem is that the 'a' in a == 5 is lacking the var data that would tell us the var id!!
we may have to set as invalid and assert so we find these problems easily.

we seem to insert a return at the end of the program. this is not necesary anymore
	and the return after call main is also useless, i think...


calc as much shit as possible during type check, like how much stack in bytes a function decl uses
