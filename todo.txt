problem is that the 'a' in a == 5 is lacking the var data that would tell us the var id!!
we may have to set as invalid and assert so we find these problems easily.

we seem to insert a return at the end of the program. this is not necesary anymore
	and the return after call main is also useless, i think...


calc as much shit as possible during type check, like how much stack in bytes a function decl uses

make other structs work. only s_color works

multipel return values

we need casting

does !!foo work?


we probably want assert that things of type e_node_type don't have a type_node set, because that is just confusing

if whatever > int - float FAILS!!
	we do float float subtraction, which is wrong because one of the args is int!! we need to first convert the int to a float?
